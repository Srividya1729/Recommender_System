# Matching seekers and helpers in online health support groups

# Weekly Updates :

<h1>
09/26 - 10/03
</h1>

**Challenges Overcome / Questions :**

   1) Had an elaborate discussion with Prof Ed and decided to shift focus to content based feature extraction to facilitate user-user recommendation, whilst keeping the implemented KNN approach as the baseline
   2) Designed a plan and defined sub tasks including fingerprinting, matching and tracking for user-user recommendation

<h3> Anusha Prakash </h3>

**Status of Previous week Tasks :**

   * Completed 3 (full) and 1 (partial)
   * Based on the mid week discussion with Prof Ed, we prioritized stretch goal over the other tasks for the week


**Upcoming Tasks:**

   1) Based on the discussion with Prof Ed, create a document summarizing the approach for handling multiple components of the system with timely update of results
   2) Obtain Metadata for users and do feature engineering on it for the given task
   3) Explore neural approaches to deal with sparsity in user metadata

<h1>
09/19 - 09/26
</h1>

**Challenges Overcome / Questions :**

   1) Data splitting (Chronology, random etc)
   2) Formulating K-NN approach with above split mechanism
   3) Metrics on which the value of K is chosen

<h3> Anusha Prakash </h3>

**Status of Previous week Tasks :**

   * Completed  
   * Recommended slight modification of user-user similarity task formulation to improve the results 
   

**Upcoming Tasks:**

   1) Implement the modified version of user-user similarity task using KNN.
   2) Implement the modified version of user-user similarity task using PMF.
   3) Statistical analysis supporting the chronological split of training - dev data.
   4) Stretch goal: Start looking at the content of the comments to extract additional features.
